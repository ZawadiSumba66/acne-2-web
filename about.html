        <p>Earlier data was in small amount thus easily structured .However, there are so many resources generating online data which leads to pile of unstructured data.</p>
         <p class="dark">Unstructured data is difficult to mine and sort through to reach a quantifiable amount that can be analysed.AI-based models thus come in handy by exploring such a vast sphere without human intervention </p>

    <h1>What we do</h1>

This also enables that they get to the right people at the right time. </p>
